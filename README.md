# Description:
Developed a cyber network security analysis project to detect and analyze potential threats to IT infrastructure. This project involved exploring network traffic data using Python and pandas to process, clean, and analyze large datasets. The implementation of Anomaly Scores analysis model enabled the identification of anomalous patterns and correlation with potential attack types.

# Responsibilities:

Prepared and cleaned cybersecurity datasets from various sources.
Utilized pandas and seaborn for data exploration and visualization of Anomaly Scores distribution.
Implemented Anomaly Scores analysis algorithm for anomaly pattern detection.
Conducted correlation analysis between Anomaly Scores and attack types.
Generated reports and visualizations to present analysis results effectively.

# Achievements:

Enhanced understanding of cyber network security and identification of potential threats.
Demonstrated data analysis skills and statistical understanding to evaluate system security.

# Technologies Used:
Python, pandas, seaborn, statistical analysis
